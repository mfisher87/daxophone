# Daxophone

This repo is to record open build instructions for a
[daxophone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daxophone), a musicial instrument categorized
as a "friction idiophone" alongside the musical saw and glass harmonica.

The instrument consists of:

* **Soundboard**: The "base" of the instrument, the wooden **Soundboard** contains
  contact microphones.
* **Tongue**: Mounted to the **Base**, the wooden **Tongue** is the portion of the
  instrument that vibrates to generate sound.
* **Dax**: One hand uses the **Dax** against the tongue to manipulate tone and texture.
* **Bow**: One hand **Bows** the **Tongue** to generate vibration.

  Includes details on a "contoured soundplate" design enhancement that I feel is
  important. I found diagrams showing this contour in the past but I can't find them
  now.
